        <h2>6. Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>Webwide is an inclusive long-form discussion board community for web designers, developers and makers. We‚Äôre united by a passion for creating on the web and supporting our industry community.</p>
        <p>We welcome members from all around the world, however Webwide is an English-language community and all posts must be in inteligable (not neccesarily perfect!) English.</p>
        <h3>6.1. Our Pledge</h3>
        <p>We, the Webwide community and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>

        <p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.</p>

        <h3>6.2. Our Standards</h3>
        <p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
        community include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</li>
            <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
            <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
            <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
            and learning from the experience</li>
            <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
            overall community</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
            advances of any kind</li>
            <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
            <li>Public or private harassment</li>
            <li>Publishing others‚Äô private information, such as a physical or email
            address, without their explicit permission</li>
            <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
            professional setting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3. Self-promotion Guidelines</h3>
            <p>In general, the web community is a community of creators and the Webwide platform aims to create a space where members are able to show off their hard work. However, there must be some limitations to this to prevent abuse of this openness and keep the community healthy.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Members are free to post (in an appropriate forum) their own educational, thought-provoking, discussion-worthy or entertaining content that provides value to the community.</li>
            <li>Members are free to post directly about their own projects for the purposes of promotion and community input in the <code>#show-and-tell</code> channel.</li>
            <li>When posting for the sole purpose of selling services, this must only be done in the ‚Äò<code>#job-postings</code> channel.</li>
            <li>Contacting users directly via direct message or their listed social details for commercial purposes is STRICTLY PROHIBITED unless they have asked you specifically to do so.</li>
            <li>Medium and other centralised/paywalled blog platform links are discouraged but not strictly disallowed.</li>
            <li>Affiliate/referral links are allowed as part of a genuine and requested recommendation only.</li>
            <li>We kindly ask that you do not specfically promote ‚Äòcompeting‚Äô communities on the platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.4. Community Etiquette</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not ‚Äòcross-post‚Äô the same discussion in to multiple channels, just pick the one you think fits best (there are no infractions for posting in an incorrect category).</li>
            <li>Be aware that everything posted on Webwide may be public and may be archived.</li>
            <li>Self-promotion is welcomed as per the above guidelines, but please make an effort to join in with our community and provide value to other members.
            <li>When asking a question, think about the context of your problem and provide as much supporting information as you can (what have you tried? what exactly are you trying to achieve? etc).</li>
            <li>If you post a question that you later find the answer to off-site, please update your thread with that answer if possible for the next person in need who finds it.</li>
            <li>If you receive help or feedback on your thread, please ensure you respect our other community members by recognising their effort and kindness with a reply or a reaction and updating us on your progress. Users that sign up only to post a promotion thread and leave risk having content removed.</li>
            <li>An open dialogue about politics is important, but please avoid bringing unneccesarily bringing politics in to unrelated discussions</li>
            <li>We are fortunate to welcome users from all over the world, many who speak English as a second language, be kind if pointing out spelling or grammar mistakes and only do so if you believe it affects the message of the post.</li>
            <li>Discord will often try to automatically embed information from links, if the embed card does not add to the discussion, please press the close button in the top right while hovering over an embed to avoid filling the feed.</li>
            <li>Do not try to police other users, please contact an admin/moderator for any behaviour you are unhappy with or violates this CoC.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.5. Enforcement Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Community administrators and moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
        acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
        response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
        or harmful.</p>
        <p>Community administrators and moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
        threads, posts, code, issues and other contributions that are
        not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
        decisions when appropriate.</p>

        <h3>6.6. Scope</h3>
        <p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and our standards apply off-site in other public spaces too. Evidence of standards-breaching behaviour on social media or other communities may result in suspension.</p>

        <h3>6.6. Enforcement</h2>
        <p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
        reported to the community moderators responsible for enforcement by using the forums
        ‚Äòreport‚Äô functionality or via email at webwide@addy.codes.
        All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.</p>
        <p>All community moderators are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
        reporter of any incident.</p>
        <p>Community moderators will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
        the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:</p>
        <h4>Correction</h4>
        <p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
        unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
        clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
        behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.</p>

        <p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A violation through a single incident.</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No

        those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
        includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
        like social media. Violating these terms or repeat warnings may lead to a temporary or
        permanent ban.</p>

        communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
        private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
        with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
        Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.</p>
        <h4>Permanent Ban</h4>
        <p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
        standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
        individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.</p>
        <p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
        the community.</p>
