    <section id="intro">
        <h2>üëã 1. Introduction</h2>

        <h4>What happened to Webwide.io forums?</h4>
        <p>You may remember us as the forum Webwide.io, the Webwide forums were sunset indefinitely in September 2021 in favour of this new Discord channel. Same founder (hello, it's Adam!), same spirit, more of the same fun challenges and activities and hopefully lots of the same great community members but in a sleeker and easier to use package.</p>

    <section id="basics">
        <h2>üí¨ 2. Discord Basics</h2>
        <p>Discord is a popular instant messaging app, once targeted specifically towards gamers as a fast, lightweight, easy-to-use community platform, these key features have led to widespread adoption across a huge number of communities.</p>
        <p>Discord is free to use and can be used in your browser or with a <a href="https://discord.com/download" target="_blank">native app</a> for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android or iOS.</p>

            <li>Public or private harassment</li>
            <li>Publishing others‚Äô private information, such as a physical or email

        <h3>6.3. Self-promotion Guidelines</h3>
            <p>In general, the web community is a community of creators and the Webwide platform aims to create a space where members are able to show off their hard work. However, there must be some limitations to this to prevent abuse of this openness and keep the community healthy.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Members are free to post (in an appropriate forum) their own educational, thought-provoking, discussion-worthy or entertaining content that provides value to the community.</li>
            <li>Members are free to post directly about their own projects for the purposes of promotion and community input in the <code>#show-and-tell</code> channel.</li>
            <li>When posting for the sole purpose of selling services, this must only be done in the ‚Äò<code>#job-postings</code> channel.</li>
            <li>Contacting users directly via direct message or their listed social details for commercial purposes is STRICTLY PROHIBITED unless they have asked you specifically to do so.</li>
            <li>Medium and other centralised/paywalled blog platform links are discouraged but not strictly disallowed.</li>
            <li>Affiliate/referral links are allowed as part of a genuine and requested recommendation only.</li>
            <li>We kindly ask that you do not specfically promote ‚Äòcompeting‚Äô communities on the platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.4. Community Etiquette</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Please display your preferred pronouns either in your nickname or profile about section.</li>
            <li>Do not ‚Äòcross-post‚Äô the same discussion in to multiple channels, just pick the one you think fits best (there are no infractions for posting in an incorrect category).</li>
            <li>Be aware that everything posted on Webwide may be public and may be archived.</li>
            <li>Self-promotion is welcomed as per the above guidelines, but please make an effort to join in with our community and provide value to other members.
            <li>When asking a question, think about the context of your problem and provide as much supporting information as you can (what have you tried? what exactly are you trying to achieve? etc).</li>
            <li>If you post a question that you later find the answer to off-site, please update your thread with that answer if possible for the next person in need who finds it.</li>
            <li>If you receive help or feedback on your thread, please ensure you respect our other community members by recognising their effort and kindness with a reply or a reaction and updating us on your progress. Users that sign up only to post a promotion thread and leave risk having content removed.</li>
            <li>An open dialogue about politics is important, but please avoid bringing unneccesarily bringing politics in to unrelated discussions</li>
            <li>We are fortunate to welcome users from all over the world, many who speak English as a second language, be kind if pointing out spelling or grammar mistakes and only do so if you believe it affects the message of the post.</li>
            <li>Discord will often try to automatically embed information from links, if the embed card does not add to the discussion, please press the close button in the top right while hovering over an embed to avoid filling the feed.</li>
            <li>Do not try to police other users, please contact an admin/moderator for any behaviour you are unhappy with or violates this CoC.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.5. Enforcement Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Community administrators and moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
        acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
